#Day 13 was just a day to talk about debugging.
#Step 1 - Understand what the problem is asking. You can't solve the proble without first understanding what is happening.
#Step 2 - Know your input and out. Know what the problem needs for the input and what is the expected output.
#Step 3 - Understand what each line of code is doing, not what you think it is doing.
#Step 4 - Run the code often, in order to catch bugs as they appear.
#Step 5 - Use print.
#Step 6 - Use break points.
#Step 7 - If all else fail bring down the hammer by using a DeBugger.
